Despite these rates, we still have a poor understanding of what psychological and biological processes may be promoting the development and maintenance of the disorder. One of the leading models of depression emphasizes that the way patients respond to a pleasant event - such that they are less likely to enjoy something typically viewed as enjoyable (e.g., eating, winning money) \u2013 predicts the onset of symptoms and the likelihood of staying depressed for a longer period of time. Despite these findings, we still have an incomplete science of depression. We have yet to examine how depressed individuals respond to all types of positive experiences. Most of these studies are based on Hedonic rewards, which are positive events that are rewarding in the short-term because they provide pleasure and relaxation. No study to date has examined how individuals respond to long-term and more meaningful sources of positive emotions, termed Eudaimonic rewards. Examples include: feeling good when you do something you believe in (authenticity) or that is meaningful to you (e.g., succeeding at school/work)."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"In this study, you were asked to indicate a social issue that was important to you and complete game in which you fought to gain money for yourself (hedonic reward), to increase, by up to $15, how much money will be donated to a charity supporting the social issue of importance to you (eudaimonic reward), and to decrease, by up to $15, how much money will be donated to a charity that opposes the social issue of importance to you, similar to \u201cfighting for good and against evil\u201d (eudaimonic reward). Your responses will allow us to validate this task as a measure of hedonic and eudaimonic rewards, and examine whether responses to pleasant and meaningful experiences influence the development and maintenance of depression.
